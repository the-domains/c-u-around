## Welcome to C-U Around: a podcast for Champaign-Urbana by Champaign-Urbana

Hello, my name is Tom Mohr. Welcome to C-U Around. C-U Around is a podcast and blog dedicated to highlighting all of the amazing things that Champaign Urbana has to offer, from the night life to the family life, sports events to music events, we are going to capture it all! 

The diversity, creativity, and business ventures that are happening within our own streets are fascinating and I want to discover, learn about, and share them with all of you. I may end up having a good meal at one of our amazing restaurants or bars and talking about that along the way too!

So thank you so much for stopping by and checking out the podcast. If you have any questions you can feel free to get a hold of me, or if you have an idea of what you would like to hear from the podcast or have featured on the podcast let me know! This is for the community!

Talk to you soon.

Tom
